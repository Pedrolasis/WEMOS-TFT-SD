Hello,

I want to make a program with WEMOS D1 mini a TFT screen and SD card that displays .jpg photo's from the card.

I can do the same with an ESP32, but can't work out how to do the same with WEMOS D1 mini.

My preferance is for iLi9341 (Bodmer library) but am open to suggestions.

Many thanks for any help.

Peter.
